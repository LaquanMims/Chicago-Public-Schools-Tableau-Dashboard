# Chicago-Public-Schools-Tableau-Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed data from the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) 2019-2020 school year. My goal was to explore three key factors from High Schools within the third-largest school district in the United States. First, I aimed to assess how individual schools and the CPS district as a whole performed across various metrics. Additionally, I sought to understand the organizational structure of High Schools and how it determines the support and resources a school needs. Lastly, I investigated how CPS High Schools prepare students for college.
